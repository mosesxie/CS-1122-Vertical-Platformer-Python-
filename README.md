Game Proposal

Using Python, we will make a single level platformer game that has randomly generated obstacles (platforms). The player will be able to jump, move, crouch, etc based on the player’s keystrokes. For example, pressing the up arrow key would be input to make the player-controlled character jump. The length of time that the player takes to finish the game will be recorded and output to the screen once the player has reached the final destination. The game can be replayed, therefore the shortest amount of time taken to complete the stage will be the “highest score”.
